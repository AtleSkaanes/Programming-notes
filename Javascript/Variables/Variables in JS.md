### Types
As previously mentioned, `JavaScript` is a dynamically typed language, so you don't have to declare what `type` a variable has. Therefore, there are only a few variable types that you need to know about.

| Variable | Example                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Number   | 5, 2.4, 10               |
| String   | "Hello World!", "35"     |
| Array    | [5,2,6], ["this","that"] |
