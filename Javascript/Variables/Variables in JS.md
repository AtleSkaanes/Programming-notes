### Types
As previously mentioned, `JavaScript` is a dynamically typed language, so you don't have to declare what `type` a variable has. Therefore, there are only a few variable types that you need to know about.


| Variable | Example                  | Note              |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Number   | 5, 2.4, 10               |                   | 
| String   | "Hello World!", "35"     | [[Strings in JS]] |
| Array    | [5,2,6], ["this","that"] | [[Arrays in JS]]  |

### Keywords

Beside types, you can get different variables depending on the keyword you choose to initialize it with.
There are 3 variable keywords:
